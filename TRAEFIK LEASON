Traefik creates, for each container, a corresponding service and router.


The Service automatically gets a server per instance of the container,
and the router automatically gets a rule defined by defaultRule (if no rule for it was defined in labels).

i.e
    - traefik.http.router.cont-name.rule= [RULE]

In general when configuring a Traefik provider, a service assigned to one (or several) router(s) must be defined as well for the routing to be functional.

There are, however, exceptions when using label-based configurations:

    If a label defines a router (e.g. through a router Rule) and a label defines a service (e.g. implicitly through a loadbalancer
     server port value), but the router does not specify any service, then that service is automatically assigned to the router.
    If a label defines a router (e.g. through a router Rule) but no service is defined, then a service is automatically created and assigned to the router.


To update the configuration of the Router automatically attached to the container, add labels starting with

 traefik.http.routers.<name-of-your-choice>.
  and followed by the option you want to change.

  For example, to change the rule, you could add the label traefik.http.routers.my-container.rule=Host(`mydomain.com`).


For Traefik to work on swarm mode for our use case

Create custom network using the overlay driver

Create traefik service configuration

Create compose network to make use of already created network as driver

all service should connect to that network to be made available
